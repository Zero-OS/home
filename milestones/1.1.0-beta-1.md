### IMPORTANT

- this is a very early release to show all potential of zero-os
- known issues
    - orchestrator scalibility: AYS 9.0 does not scale well enough, are waiting for a 9.3 release
    - the 0-store & 0-tlog server are working well but are too statefull and we wanna do some refactoring in beta2
    - very minimal testing
