## beta 2

Beta 2 is not a full functioning release, the goal of this release is to take a step back & refactor certain elements of the zero-os ecosystem, this to make sure we are ready for a faster more scalable beta3 which will be full functioning again.

### improvements

- zero-stor 
    - performance tests 
    - well tested client for go-lang & python
    - client can run as daemon (for low level access & high level)
    - docu well done
- zero-tlog
    - needs to be stateless (NEW)
    - can do compression/encryption
- zero-robot
    - uses ays 9.3: serious rework of ays which is much more scalable & ready for a distributed world
    - there will be many more instances of zero-robot each managing a part of the stack
    - only requirement for zer0-robot = git server & js93 sandbox
- zero-hub
  - metadata accessible over well defined rest interface
    - flists for our core system services e.g. zero-db/zero-stor/zero-robot...  
  - all data needs to be on zero-stor (client directly in zero-os)
  - uses zero-id/zero-db/zero-stor
- zero-os
  - containers
    - well tested containers support
    - seamless integration from docker (from image or by means of building) (*)
    - export/import container to zero-hub/zero-stor (*)
    - mount paths from zero-os underlying fs to specific location in container e.g. /host/code to /code in container
  - vm's (no vdisk support !)
    - ubuntu 16.04 & 17.10 only for now
    - boots kernel from VM disk & rest of file system from flists (like containers)
       - can mount flists but also paths from zero-os as described above
    - start vm, push ssh key
    - will be used as basis for e.g. Kubernetes
    - attach to network in multiple ways (zero-tier, bridge, vxlan, ...)
- full blown kubernetes support as host
    - kubernetes will run inside VM's (*)

(*) uses zero-robot for coordination
    
### unsupported features

- no virtual disk support
- no orchestrator from 2.x series
