## beta 3

Beta 3 is not a full functioning release, the goal of this release is to take a step back & refactor certain elements of the zero-os ecosystem, this to make sure we are ready for a faster more scalable beta3 which will be full functioning again.

### improvements

- zero-db (single node, no replication...)
    - key/value store with reservations/security on top of local store (is like zero-stor but for DB access)
    - has blockchain features, all data can be verified against chain
    - implemented using tarantool
    - client takes care of having multiple copies & sharding in later version (client is also tarantool)
- zero-tlog
    - needs to be stateless (NEW)
    - can do compression/encryption
- zero-robot
    - probably lots of improvements still compared to beta 2
- zero-id
    - identity management uses zero-db & zero-robot
    - implemented using tarantool
    - in this version no link with ItsYou.Online yet (in future release IYO will use the zero-id as backend)
- zero-directory
    - metadata server uses zero-db & zero-robot
    - implemented using tarantool 
- zero-hub
  - metadata accessible over well defined rest interface
    - flists for our core system services e.g. zero-db/zero-stor/zero-robot...  
  - all data needs to be on zero-stor (client directly in zero-os)
  - uses zero-id/zero-db/zero-stor
- zero-os
  - containers & vm's from beta2, probably some improvements & bugfixes
- full blown kubernetes support as host
    - kubernetes will run inside VM's (*)
- zero-os runs in virtualbox (optionally kvm on ubuntu)
   - golang command line for win/ubuntu/osx uses virtualbox (requirement)
      - can run more than 1 instance
      - can mount folders from host to the zero-os through the virtualbox mounting feature
   - commands like 
      - zos env configure : ask location of zero-hub & credentials
      - zos env start -n "myname" --mem=2GB --disksize=20GB ...
      - zos robot start -n "myname" --giturl="..." #how can we use ssh-agent?
      - zos env stop
      - zos env list
    
(*) uses zero-robot for coordination
    
### unsupported features

- no virtual disk support
- no orchestrator from 2.x series 

### known issues

- zero-stor/zero-os/zero-db
    - no reservations & blockchain integration
