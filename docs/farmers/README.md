### Register as a farmer
#### Create an IYO account
The first step to take in order to become a farmer is to register on [ItsYouOnline](http://itsyou.online/).  
To do so, head to http://itsyou.online/ and follow the sign-in procedure.

#### Join the theefold.farmers organization
Once you have your IYO account, the next step is to join the theefold.farmers organization.

**TODO**: figure out way for people to get invited to the organization. In first phase we'll probably just receive requests from chat or something
we can maybe automate with a small web app that present a form and send invitation automatically

### Setup your farm
**TODO**: @alichaddad can you elaborate and document an example of a farm setup

### Configure your nodes
**TODO**: @maxux, please document bios config, bootstrap service usage, ...
